# Introduction

**Catie 🐸**

Your app is coming along great so far, but it would be even cooler if you could scale and rotate your image views by using pinch and rotation gestures!

You might find: now that you know how to use one gesture recognizer, the others will come easily to you.

# Demo

## Main.storyboard

**Catie 🐸**

* Open `Main.storyboard` and drag both a pinch and rotation gesture recognizer onto the monkey.

## Main.storyboard + ViewController.swift

Now, hold option and select `ViewController.swift` to open it in the Assistant Editor.

* Connect an outlet from the pinch gesture recognizer to the bottom of the class, naming the action `handlePinch`.

```swift
  @IBAction func handlePinch(_ sender: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
  }
```

* And rename the parameter to be less generic: `recognizer` is a more specific name than `sender`.

```swift
  }
  
  @IBAction func handlePinch(_ recognizer: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
  }
}
```

* Now take the same steps for the Rotation Gesture Recognizer, using the method name `handleRotate`.

> (The first step is the action-dragging.)

```swift
  }

  @IBAction func handlePinch(_ recognizer: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
  }
  
  @IBAction func handleRotate(_ recognizer: UIRotationGestureRecognizer) {
  }
}
```

Close up the assistant editor with Command-Return, and then open up ViewController.swift.

## ViewController.swift

Both of these methods should begin the same as handlePan; you can't do anything useful without a view.

```swift
  @IBAction func handlePinch(_ recognizer: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
    guard let recognizerView = recognizer.view else {
      return
    }
  }

  @IBAction func handleRotate(_ recognizer: UIRotationGestureRecognizer) {
    guard let recognizerView = recognizer.view else {
      return
    }
  }
```

In each of these methods, you'll need to *transform* the recognizer's view.

# Interlude 

**Jessy 😺**

**[Slide 1]** Every view has a what's called a "transform". Behind the scenes, it's a  matrix of CGFloats.  Practically, it represents a combination of the rotation, scale, and translation applied to the view. 

**[Slide 2]** Apple has provided a lot of built in functions to make working with transforms easy. In a moment, you'll be using some of these to update the view’s transform based on gestures.

**[Slide 3]** Just like you got translation from a UIPanGestureRecognizer, you can get scaling information from a 
UIPinchGestureRecognizer. Its "scale" property is a CGFloat, which starts at 1.

As you move your fingers farther apart, the value becomes larger than 1. And it approaches zero as you bring your fingers together.

**Catie 🐸**

**[Slide 4]** However, scale is a settable property – which allows you to set a new reference, multiplying all of the default scale values by some number.

The way you'll do that in the `handlePinch` method will be to continuously reset the scale to 1, after scaling the view. Effectively, that will say, "the size that I've pinched this view to is now considered to be its default size, as far as the pinch is concerned".

It's an easy way to handle what you need, that doesn't require manually keeping track of how you've transformed the view.

# Demo 

## ViewController.swift

**Catie 🐸**

* In `handlePinch`, set the view's transform to be itself, scaled according to the pinch gesture recognizer's scale.

```swift
      return
    }

    recognizerView.transform = recognizerView.transform.scaledBy(x: recognizer.scale, y: recognizer.scale)
  }
```

* And then, perform the scale reset.

```swift
    recognizerView.transform = recognizerView.transform.scaledBy(x: recognizer.scale, y: recognizer.scale)
    recognizer.scale = 1
  }
```

* You'll handle rotation in the same way. Except for rotation, you reset to zero, not one.

> HI EDITOR!! Screwed this one up first time, sorry!

```swift
    guard let recognizerView = recognizer.view else {
      return
    }

    recognizerView.transform = recognizerView.transform.rotated(by: recognizer.rotation)
    recognizer.rotation = 0
  }
```

**Jessy 😺**

* Build and run. 

> HI THERE EDITOR! Ignore the first build, I had to figure out how to use two-finger gestures in the simulator :[

> play around with two-finger gestures while I say this next part. You can't rotate *and* pinch at the same time yet.

Now you should be able to scale and rotate the monkey!

We highly recommend running on a device if possible, because pinches and rotations are kinda hard to do on the Simulator.

If the simulator's all you've got, you hold down the option key and drag to simulate two fingers. If you  hold down shift and option at the same time, that'll move the simulated fingers, together, to a different position. 

# Interlude

**Catie 🐸**

At this point, all three of your gesture recognizers are working, but you may have noticed that you can't perform them at the same time. 

By default, once one gesture recognizer on a view “claims” the gesture, no others can recognize a gesture from that point on. However, you can change this by overriding a UIGestureRecognizerDelegate method.

# Demo

## ViewController.swift

**Catie 🐸**

* At the bottom of `ViewController.swift`, create a ViewController class extension and have it adopt the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol:

```swift
}

extension ViewController: UIGestureRecognizerDelegate {

}
```

* Then implement one of the delegate’s optional methods: `shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith otherGestureRecognizer`.

```swift
  func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith otherGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
    <#code#>
  }
```

* You won't need either of the parameters.

```swift
func gestureRecognizer(_: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith _: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
```

This method tells the gesture recognizer whether it's allowed to recognize a gesture if another recognizer has already detected *its* gesture.

* The default implementation always returns false – but for this app, it should be true instead.

```swift
  func gestureRecognizer(_: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith _: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
    return true
  }
```

## Main.storyboard

**Jessy 😺**

* Now, open Main.storyboard, and for each gesture recognizer connect its delegate outlet to the view controller.  

> Do one.

You'll need to do it three times; multi-selecting doesn't work.

> Do the other two.

* Build and run the app again.

Now you should be able to drag the monkey, pinch to scale it, and rotate it, all at once. This makes for a much more natural experience.
