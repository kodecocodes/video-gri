# Introduction

**Catie üê∏**

At this point you know pretty much everything you need to use the built-in gesture recognizers in your apps. But what if you want to detect some kind of gesture not supported by the built-in recognizers? You can write your own! 

You‚Äôll try that out by detecting if you ‚Äútickle‚Äù a view, moving your finger several times back and forth.

# Demo

> HI EDITOR IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOU: There's system audio included in the screen recording file for this video that we need in during the builds in addition to the narration track, so don't delete that audio! :]

**Catie üê∏**

* Create a new `UIGestureRecognizer` subclass named `TickleGestureRecognizer`.

## TickleGestureRecognizer.swift

There are two constants that define what a tickle is. 

* One is are how many times you need to switch the direction your finger is moving. Let's call that `requiredTickleCount`.

```swift
import UIKit

class TickleGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer {
  let requiredTickleCount = 3
}
```

* The other is a range, in points, in which you'll consider finger movement to represent a tickle.

> HELLO EDITOR. I typed this wrong manymany many many times sorry!

```swift
  let requiredTickleCount = 3
  let tickleDistanceRange: ClosedRange<CGFloat> = 2.5...25
}
```

You'll be able to tweak those numbers at the end of this video, if you want.

You'll also need four variables.

* One is the active tickle count.

```swift
  let tickleDistanceRange: ClosedRange<CGFloat> = 2.5...25

  var tickleCount = 0
}
```

* Another is a touch location `CGPoint`.

```swift
  var tickleCount = 0
  var touchLocation: CGPoint?
}
```

* And you'll need a direction, which, as we went over in an earlier video, can also be represented with a `CGPoint`.

```swift
  var touchLocation: CGPoint?
  var tickleDirection: CGPoint?
}
```

* Finally, store the total distance since switching the direction.

```swift
  var tickleDirection: CGPoint?
  var totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch: CGFloat = 0
}
```

Of course, these properties are specific to the tickle gesture. You‚Äôll need different, custom properties, if you‚Äôre making a recognizer for a different type of gesture.

**[Slide 1]** What will be consistent in all your custom gesture recognizers is that you'll be overriding four methods. touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded, and touchesCancelled.

# Demo

**Jessy üò∫**

## TickleGestureRecgonizer.swift

* Let's begin by stubbing out all four of those.

```swift
  var totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch: CGFloat = 0

  override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesCancelled(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent) {

  }
}
```

* You're not going to need to make use of `event`. shift-control double click on all four of them and then you can disregard them by typing underscore.

```swift
  override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesCancelled(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {

  }
}
```

* In "Ended" and "Canceled", you won't actually need the touches, either.

> shift-control double click them and hit delete twice.

```swift
  override func touchesEnded(_: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {

  }

  override func touchesCancelled(_: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {

  }
```

* The TickleGestureRecgonizer is a single-finger gesture, so for "Began" and "Moved", you'll start by getting the first touch in the set.

```swift
  override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
    guard let touch = touches.first else {
      return
    }
  }

  override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
    guard let touch = touches.first else {
      return
    }
  }
```

* Storing `touchLocation` is all you need to do in `touchesBegan`.

```swift
  var totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch: CGFloat = 0

  override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
    guard let touch = touches.first else {
      return
    }

    touchLocation = touch.location(in: view)
  }
}
```

* Then, for `touchesMoved`, you'll use that touch location.

```swift
  override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
    guard
      let touch = touches.first,
      let lastTouchLocation = self.touchLocation
    else {
      return
    }
  }
```

* Get the new location from the moved touch, and then you can calculate the change since the last time it was stored.

> HI Editor!!!! Messed upthe second line here a few times.

```swift
      return
    }

    let touchLocation = touch.location(in: view)
    let touchLocationChange = CGPoint(
      x: touchLocation.x - lastTouchLocation.x,
      y: touchLocation.y - lastTouchLocation.y
    )
  }
```

* Then, update the stored `touchLocation`.

```swift
    let touchLocation = touch.location(in: view)
    let touchLocationChange = CGPoint(
      x: touchLocation.x - lastTouchLocation.x,
      y: touchLocation.y - lastTouchLocation.y
    )
    self.touchLocation = touchLocation
```

* You'll need to calculate the length of the `touchLocationChange` vector. And for now, there's no better way to do that than to use the Pythagorean theorem again.

```swift
    self.touchLocation = touchLocation
    let tickleDistance = (
      touchLocationChange.x * touchLocationChange.x
      + touchLocationChange.y * touchLocationChange.y
    ).squareRoot()
  }
```

* Make sure that distance is long enough to bother with before proceeding.

```swift
    ).squareRoot()

    guard tickleDistance > tickleDistanceRange.lowerBound else {
      return
    }
  }
```

**Catie üê∏**

* The rest of the code in this method will be in a switch on `tickleDirection`. 

> HAI HELLO AGAIN EDITOR! Messed up the start of this switch statement.

```swift
      return
    }

    switch tickleDirection {
    case <#pattern#>:
      <#code#>
    default:
      <#code#>
    }
  }
```

* In the default case, add `tickleDistance` to `totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch`. 

```swift
    default:
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch += tickleDistance
    }
```

You'll do more in that case shortly.

* In the case where `tickleDirection` has a value, you'll want to find out if it's pointing opposite to the `touchLocationChange`. For that, you can use the dot product, which you get by multiplying their components together and summing those products.

```swift
	 switch tickleDirection {
    case let tickleDirection?:
      let dotProduct =
        touchLocation.x * tickleDirection.x
        + touchLocation.y * tickleDirection.y
    default:
```

* If the dot product is less than zero, then the two vectors face more than 90 degrees apart from each other, which we'll consider a direction change. 

```swift
        + touchLocation.y * tickleDirection.y

      guard dotProduct < 0 
    default:
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch += tickleDistance
    }
```

* If the direction hasn't changed, you can use the `fallthrough` keyword to continue to the code in the default case.

>HI EDITOR! Messed this up once.

```swift
      guard dotProduct < 0 else {
        fallthrough
      }
    default:
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch += tickleDistance
    }
```

* You'll also want to `fallthrough` when `tickleDirection` is nil, but before that, give it the correct value: `touchLocationChange`.

```swift
        fallthrough
      }
    case nil:
      tickleDirection = touchLocationChange
      fallthrough
    default:
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch += tickleDistance
    }
```

* And finally, we're to the point where we get to increment the `tickleCount`. When that happens, you'll need to give new values to `tickleDirection` and `totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch`.

```swift
      guard dotProduct < 0 else {
        fallthrough
      }

      tickleCount += 1
      self.tickleDirection = touchLocationChange
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch = 0
    case nil:
```

# Interlude 

**Jessy üò∫**

You've already *used* a gesture recognizer's state in this course. Now's the time when you'll be managing it yourself.

**[Slide 2]** A gesture begins in the "possible" state. Past that point, you'll typically update the state to .began, send any updates with .changed, and finalize it with .ended.

**[Slide 3]** But for this simple gesture recognizer, once the user has tickled enough, that‚Äôs it ‚Äì you'll just set the state to ended.

# Demo 

**Jessy üò∫**

* When the state is possible and you've met the tickling requirement, end the gesture.

> HI AGAIN! Messed the start up twice, I think. Sorry!

```swift
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch = 0
      if state == .possible && tickleCount == requiredTickleCount {
        state = .ended
      }
    case nil:
```


* The only other state you'll need to set is `failed`, which you'll need to do when `totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch` has gotten too large.

```swift
    default:
      totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch += tickleDistance
      if totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch > tickleDistanceRange.upperBound {
        state = .failed
      }
    }
```

When a gesture's state changes to failed, ended, or cancelled, its `reset` method gets called by UIKit.

* Override it, and reset all four of the gesture's stored variables.

> HI EDITOR! Use the second take of this please.

```swift
        state = .failed
      }
    }
  }

  override func reset() {
    tickleCount = 0
    touchLocation = nil
    tickleDirection = nil
    totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch = 0
  }

  override func touchesEnded(_: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
```

* And lastly, for this file, call `reset` from your two currently-empty touch handling methods.

```swift
    totalDistanceSinceDirectionSwitch = 0
  }

  override func touchesEnded(_: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
    reset()
  }

  override func touchesCancelled(_: Set<UITouch>, with _: UIEvent) {
    reset()
  }
}
```

**Catie üê∏**

* OK, now let's use your completed gesture recognizer! Open `ViewController.swift`.

## ViewController.swift

* Copying `handleTap` and changing the name to `handleTickle` is a good way to start.

```swift
  @objc func handleTap(recognizer: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    chompPlayer.play()
  }

  @objc func handleTickle(recognizer: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    chompPlayer.play()
  }
}
```

* But you'll want to use your own gesture recognizer as its argument, and use the `laughPlayer`.


```swift
  @objc func handleTickle(recognizer: TickleGestureRecgonizer) {
    laughPlayer.play()
  }
```

* Making a copy of all the code in the didSet observer for `interactiveSubviews` will also be a good start.

```swift
      for subview in interactiveSubviews {
        let tapRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(
          target: self, action: #selector(handleTap)
        )
        tapRecognizer.delegate = self
        subview.addGestureRecognizer(tapRecognizer)

        let tapRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(
          target: self, action: #selector(handleTap)
        )
        tapRecognizer.delegate = self
        subview.addGestureRecognizer(tapRecognizer)
      }
```

* But you'll need to change the name `tapRecognizer` three times, to `tickleRecognizer`. 

```swift
        subview.addGestureRecognizer(tapRecognizer)

        let tickleRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(
          target: self, action: #selector(handleTap)
        )
        tickleRecognizer.delegate = self
        subview.addGestureRecognizer(tickleRecognizer)
      }
```

* Aside from that, the only other differences are changing the type you're instantiating, and the selector it will use when you set its state to `ended`.

```swift
        let tickleRecognizer = TickleGestureRecgonizer(
          target: self, action: #selector(handleTickle)
        )
```

* Build and run!

Now you know how to create custom gesture recognizers. If you want to use them for something as creepy as a laughing banana, that's up to you!
