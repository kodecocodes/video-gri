# Introduction

**Catie 🐸**

At this point, you're equipped to work with built-in gesture recognizers, and custom ones. But a lot of the lines of code you've written don't express what you're trying to do very succinctly. Instead, there's quite a bit of vector math involved. Which –yes– is necessary, but could benefit from being written in a clearer fashion.

The difficulty largely lies with CGPoints not having that many methods and properties defined. At some point, Apple might fix that, but for now, it's on you.

**[Slide 1]** Enter: the simd library.

simd's name stands for "Single instruction, multiple data". Let's compare what adding two CGPoints looks like, and the equivalent simd operation.

**[Slide 2]** For two CGPoints, you have to manually add their x components, and their y components. There's enough code involved to be distracting from the intent, and there's opportunity to not type it quite right, and introduce bugs.

**Jessy 😺**

**[Slide 3]** With simd, the math is neatly wrapped up in the plus operator. The type you see here is `double2`, which is basically a named type for a tuple of two doubles: just like CGPoint is.

**[Slide 4]** simd has types for Floats and Doubles, for vectors and matrices between 2 and 4 dimensions. We'll only be going over some of what you can do with double2s, but there's consistency across all these types which makes it easy to branch out if you need to.

**[Slide 5]** And of course, simd is only one option for making vector math easier. But we think it's the best option. For two reasons! 

One is performance. Modern iOS devices and Macs have vector coprocessors which literally allow you to perform the same instruction on multiple data with no extra cost. If you're adding a ton of CGPoints, and can make that as efficient as adding CGFloats, you can either increase your app's responsiveness or save battery life.

**[Slide 6]** The other reason to choose simd is how much code Apple has already written for you. Most of the work you'll need to put in is just type conversion.

> Create a `CGPoint.swift` file in an `extension` folder at the top of the project before beginning.

## CGPoint.swift

**Catie 🐸**

Let's begin with that in the `CGPoint.swift` file in the extension folder we created for you, in the Start folder for this video.

* The conversions you'll be doing are going to be between types from Core Graphics, and simd, so import both of those.

```swift
import CoreGraphics
import simd
```

* Extend CGPoint to have an initializer that takes a `double2`.

```swift
import simd

extension CGPoint {
  init(_ double2: double2) {

  }
}
```

* `double2`s have x and y values, just like `CGPoint`s, so just copy them over.

```swift
  init(_ double2: double2) {
    self.init(x: double2.x, y: double2.y)
  }
```

* For `double2`s, start off with an initializer that takes two `CGFloat`s, which a `CGPoint` comprises.

```swift
}

extension double2 {
  init(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) {

  }
}
```

* And `CGFloat` has a "native" property, which you can use to access their underlying `Double`.   

```swift
  init(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) {
    self.init(x: x.native, y: y.native)
  }
```

* Now, when converting from a `CGPoint`, you can deconstruct it into its two coordinates and forward them on to the initializer below.

```swift
extension double2 {
  init(_ cgPoint: CGPoint) {
    self.init(x: cgPoint.x, y: cgPoint.y)
  }

  init(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) {
```

**Jessy 😺**

* With conversion out of the way, let's give `CGPoint`s a `length` `CGFloat` property so you don't have to write the Pythagorean theorem every time.

```swift
  }

  var length: CGFloat {

  }
}

extension double2 {
```

* Let's build this up from the inside out. First, convert the point to a `double2`.

```swift
  var length: CGFloat {
    double2(self)
  }
```

* simd has a function which will get the length of that.

```swift
  var length: CGFloat {
    simd.length( double2(self) )
  }
```

* That length is a `Double`, so do one final conversion to the `CGFloat` that you need.

> HI EDITOR! Please wait for like the 3rd time I try this next part.

```swift
  var length: CGFloat {
    return CGFloat(
      simd.length( double2(self) )
    )
  }
```

Now, let's replace some lengthy code.

## ViewController.swift

**Catie 🐸**

> select this.

```swift
let vectorToFinalPointLength = (
      vectorToFinalPoint.x * vectorToFinalPoint.x
      + vectorToFinalPoint.y * vectorToFinalPoint.y
    ).squareRoot()
```

In `ViewController.swift`, in the handlePan method just above the animation, there's a constant, `vectorToFinalPointLength`, that exists only to store a calculated length. 

* You can delete it.

```swift
    finalPoint.y = min(max(finalPoint.y, bounds.minY), bounds.maxY)
    UIView.animate(
```

* Instead, just use the length property!

```swift
withDuration: TimeInterval(vectorToFinalPoint.length / 1800),
```

## TickleGestureRecgonizer.swift

> Select `tickleDistance` and hit control-command-E to show all three.

In `TickleGestureRecgonizer.swift`, in `touchesMoved`, it'll still be good to store tickleDistance in a named constant, but again, you can replace the calculations with a call to `length`.

```swift
    self.touchLocation = touchLocation
    let tickleDistance = touchLocationChange.length

    guard tickleDistance > tickleDistanceRange.lowerBound else {

```

## ViewController.swift

**Jessy 😺**

Back in the View Controller, just above the animation, there are two more lines which I think are particularly terrible to read:

> Highlight:

```swift
    finalPoint.x = min(max(finalPoint.x, bounds.minX), bounds.maxX)
    finalPoint.y = min(max(finalPoint.y, bounds.minY), bounds.maxY)
```

What these lines are expressing is that you're *clamping* `finalPoint` within `bounds`. 

* Let's head over to `CGPoint.swift`… 

## CGPoint.swift

* …and write a method for that.

```swift
  }

  func clamped(within bounds: CGRect) -> CGPoint {
   
  }
}

extension double2 {
```

* The last step of this is going to be a conversion from a `double2` to a CGPoint, so you might as well start with an empty CGPoint initializer call.

```swift
  func clamped(within bounds: CGRect) -> CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(

    )
  }
```

* simd *already has* a clamp function. You'll need the overload that uses three `double2`s.


```swift
    return CGPoint(
      clamp(<#T##x: double2##double2#>, min: <#T##double2#>, max: <#T##double2#>)
    )
```

* The first argument will be the point to clamp.

```swift
    return CGPoint(
      clamp(
        double2(self),
        min: <#T##double2#>, max: <#T##double2#>)
    )
```

* And for min and max, you'll be making use of your `double2` initializer that takes two `CGFloat`s. As well as the four "min" and "max" properties of `CGRect`.

```swift
      clamp(
        double2(self),
        min: double2(x: bounds.minX, y: bounds.minY),
        max: double2(x: bounds.maxX, y: bounds.maxY)
      )
```

## ViewController.swift

* Now, you can replace those offending lines with a clearer description of what's happening.

> HI EDITOR! Please delete the part where I accidentally try to delete a file :[

```swift
    finalPoint.y += vectorToFinalPoint.y
    finalPoint = finalPoint.clamped(within: bounds)
    UIView.animate(
```

**Catie 🐸**

> Select

```swift
    var finalPoint = recognizerView.center
    finalPoint.x += vectorToFinalPoint.x
    finalPoint.y += vectorToFinalPoint.y
```

And right above that, is some code that looks suspiciously like what we showed you in the introduction to this video: adding two points together.

## CGPoint.swift

* Fortunately, you can create a function that adds two CGPoints, and does so using the plus operator. You just need declare it as a static method.

```swift
extension CGPoint {
  static func + (point0: CGPoint, point1: CGPoint) -> CGPoint {
    return CGPoint( )
  }

  init(_ double2: double2) {
```

* Because you can add two `double2`s, and convert from `CGPoint`s to `double2`s, the code is pretty simple.

```swift
return CGPoint( double2(point0) + double2(point1) )
```

## ViewController.swift

* With that, you can give finalPoint a value using a single line of code.

```swift
var finalPoint = (recognizerView.center + vectorToFinalPoint).clamped(within: bounds)
```

* And because of that, there's no longer a reason to have it be variable.

> HI EDITOR! I typed let the first time instead of using the Fix It. Delete that typing, please!

> Use the Fix It.

```swift
    let finalPoint = (recognizerView.center + vectorToFinalPoint).clamped(within: bounds)
```

# Conclusion

**Jessy 😺**

If you're happy with how these extensions have improved the code, we think you'll find simd very handy. For gesture recognizers – certainly.
