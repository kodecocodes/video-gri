# Introduction

👯JESSY😺 To finish off this part, we're challenging you to find other places in the app's code where CGPoint extensions, based on simd, would be helpful.  
👯CATIE🐸 We found four of those. Four pieces of code to improve, with a function for each.  
👯JESSY😺 If you watched the last video, and understood our process, you should be developing a good eye for this eye for this kind of thing.  
👯CATIE🐸 Now, pause the video, see what you can improve, with simd, and then come back to see what we came up with.

# Demo

## CGPoint.swift

**Catie 🐸**

I saw a need for three more CGPoint operators.

> Highlight: 

```swift
  static func + (point0: CGPoint, point1: CGPoint) -> CGPoint {
    return CGPoint( double2(point0) + double2(point1) )
  }
```

* With plus defined, plus equals would be no sweat. The point on the left of the operator would just need the inout keyword applied, in order to be mutated.

```swift
  static func += (point0: inout CGPoint, point1: CGPoint) {
    point0 = point0 + point1
  }
```

* For "minus", I just copied "plus", and changed the two "plus" symbols to "minuses".

```swift
  static func += (point0: inout CGPoint, point1: CGPoint) {
    point0 = point0 + point1
  }

  static func - (point0: CGPoint, point1: CGPoint) -> CGPoint {
    return CGPoint( double2(point0) - double2(point1) )
  }

  init(_ double2: double2) {
```

* I also wanted a division function, but the argument on the right needed to be a `CGFloat`, not a `CGPoint`.

```swift
  }

  static func / (point: CGPoint, float: CGFloat) -> CGPoint {

  }

  init(_ double2: double2) {
```

* That involved a conversion to `double2`, for the point, and using the float's `native` property.

```swift
  static func / (point: CGPoint, float: CGFloat) -> CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(double2(point) / float.native)
  }
```

**Jessy 😺**

* I didn't use any operators, but I did make an instance method for the dot product of two `CGPoint`s. 

```swift
    )
  }

  func dot(_ point: CGPoint) -> Double {

  }
}
```

* simd has a built-in "dot" function, so, like most of the code in this file, I just had to perform conversions and let simd do the rest of the work.

```swift
  func dot(_ point: CGPoint) -> Double {
    return simd.dot( double2(self), double2(point) )
  }
```

## TickleGestureRecgonizer.swift

* In `TickleGestureRecgonizer.swift`, it was easy to add that method, in a where clause, to the first case of the switch statement in `touchesMoved`.

```swift
    switch tickleDirection {
    case let tickleDirection? where touchLocationChange.dot(tickleDirection) < 0:
      let dotProduct =
```

* That let me get rid of the guard clause and the code above it.

```swift
    case let tickleDirection? where touchLocationChange.dot(tickleDirection) < 0:
      tickleCount += 1
```

**Catie 🐸**

* I also made a change in `touchesMoved`, using the new minus operator.

```swift
    let touchLocation = touch.location(in: view)
    let touchLocationChange = touchLocation - lastTouchLocation
    self.touchLocation = touchLocation
```

## ViewController.swift

My other changes were in `ViewController.swift`'s `handlePan` method.

* First, I used plus equals to move `recognizerView`.

```swift
    let translation = recognizer.translation(in: view)
    recognizerView.center += translation
    recognizer.setTranslation(.zero, in: view)
```

* Then, I used the division operator, which allowed me to get rid of the velocity constant.

```swift
    }

    let vectorToFinalPoint = recognizer.velocity(in: view) / 15
    let bounds = UIEdgeInsetsInsetRect(view.bounds, view.safeAreaInsets)
```

# Conclusion 

👯CATIE🐸 You could build and run, but we didn't make any noticeable changes to the app.  
👯JESSY😺 We did, however, reduce a lot of repetition in our code.  
👯CATIE🐸 The app is more maintainable now, and if we use these same extensions in other apps, they'll be easier to write from the beginning.
