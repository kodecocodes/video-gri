Are you ready to move beyond UIKit's built-in controls, like buttons, switches, and sliders, and venture into the world of expressive multitouch gestures?

Complete our course on gesture recognizers in iOS, and you'll be able to pan, rotate, and scale any view in your app. You'll also learn to code custom gestures, so that any interaction you can imagine will literally be at your fingertips.

This course is part of our iOS & Swift learning path, which turns complete beginners into professional developers. And it‚Äôs available now for raywenderlich.com subscribers.  


# Demo Footage

During the ‚ÄúComplete my course‚Äù section, we want to show two types of footage (with your voice in the background).

Please specify the video segments you want to use for each type, using timestamps from your unedited demo recordings
(Record footage specially for the promo video, if you need to.): 

* **Demo:** See *Promo - Demo Footage.mp4* in the promo folder!
* **Code:** Raw Demo 1-03-3 | 0:40 through 1:17 (with all of my terrible typing cut out, please ü§≠)
