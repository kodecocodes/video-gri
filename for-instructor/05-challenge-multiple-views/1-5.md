# Introduction

👯CATIE🐸 Before we move on and create gesture recognizers in code, let's get one last bit of practice setting them up in Interface Builder.  
👯JESSY😺 Your challenge is allow the banana view to be dragged, rotated, and scaled, just like the monkey, without writing any more code.  
👯CATIE🐸 If you've watched the past three videos, you should know about all the tools you'll need.  
👯JESSY😺 Now, pause the video, go get that other view working, and then come back to see how Catie handled it.

# Demo

## Main.storyboard

**Catie 🐸**

Because gesture recognizers can only be associated with one view, I knew I was going to need three more. And, that three I already had were going to stay associated only with the monkey.

* So, for clarity in the Document Outline, I prefixed all of their names with `Monkey`.

> Monkey Pan Gesture Recognizer  
> Monkey Pinch Gesture Recognizer  
> Monkey Rotation Gesture Recognizer

* Before adding any new gesture recognizers, I checked `User Interaction Enabled` on the banana.

* Then, I dragged a new Pan Gesture Recognizer onto the banana.

* I named it `Banana Pan Gesture Recognizer`.

Then, I dragged from it, to the View Controller, to make two connections:

* One was to make the View Controller its delegate.

* The other was use `handlePan` as its action.

* Aside from it being a pinch, I took the exact same steps for a `Banana Pinch Gesture Recognizer`.

> Drag it onto the banana, name it, and set the delegate.

* Xcode is useful, filtering out actions so I only had `handlePinch` to choose.

* And last, was the `Banana Rotation Gesture Recognizer`.

> Drag, name, delegate, `handleRotate`.

* Then, I built and ran to a device.

> Use all four fingers.

All three gestures would work on the banana in the simulator, but iOS devices support enough fingers that you can put two fingers on the monkey, *and* two others on the banana.

Seeing them all work together, based on how little work this challenge involved, is a great display of how easy and satisfying gesture recognizers are to work with.
