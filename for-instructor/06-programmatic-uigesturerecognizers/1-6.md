# Introduction

**Jessy üò∫**

So far you‚Äôve created gesture recognizers using Interface Builder, but what if you wanted to do things programmatically?

It‚Äôs just as easy! You‚Äôll try it out in Swift, playing a sound effect when an image view gets tapped.

# Demo

> HI EDITOR IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOU: There's system audio included in the screen recording file for this video that we need in during the builds in addition to the narration track, so don't delete that audio! :]

**Jessy üò∫**

## Viewcontroller.swift

* To be able to play a sound, you‚Äôll need to access the AVFoundation framework. At the top of Viewcontroller.swift, import it.:

```swift
import AVFoundation
import UIKit
```

* You'll be using an AVAudioPlayer for both the monkey and the banana. Creating an initializer that uses a file name will help for that.

> HI EDITOR! Sorry messed this up the first time.

```swift
extension ViewController: UIGestureRecognizerDelegate {
  func gestureRecognizer(_: UIGestureRecognizer, shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith _: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
    return true
  }
}

extension AVAudioPlayer {
  convenience init(fileName: String) {
    
  }
}
```

* Start by getting a URL for the C-A-F file with that file name.

```swift
  convenience init(fileName: String) {
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: fileName, withExtension: "caf")!
  }
```

* Then initialize the Audio Player with the contents of that URL.

```swift
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: fileName, withExtension: "caf")!
    try! self.init(contentsOf: url)
  }
```

* Finally, call `prepareToPlay` so the sound can start with less of a hiccup.

```swift
    try! self.init(contentsOf: url)
    prepareToPlay()
  }
```

* Now, back at the top of the class, store AVAudioPlayers for the file names "chomp" and "hehehe".

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
  let chompPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(fileName: "chomp")
  let laughPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(fileName: "hehehe")

  @IBAction func handlePan(recognizer:UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
```

The laugh audio file sounds even creepier than its name; you'll hear it.

**Catie üê∏**

You're about to use the target-action pattern, to handle taps.

* And because that's an Objective-C pattern, you'll need that Objective-C attribute before it.

> HI AGAIN THERE IT IS ME. Screwed this one up twice!

```swift
    recognizer.rotation = 0
  }

  @objc func handleTap(_: UITapGestureRecognizer) {

  }
}
```

* When a tap is recognized, play the "chomp" sound.

```swift
  @objc func handleTap(_: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    chompPlayer.play()
  }
```

* You're going to need to run the same code for each of the interactive subviews. An outlet collection will work well for that. Its type can be `UIImageView Array`.

```swift
  let laughPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(fileName: "hehehe")

  @IBOutlet var interactiveSubviews: [UIImageView]!
  
  @IBAction func handlePan(recognizer:UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
```

## Viewcontroller.swift + Main.Storyboard

* Drag from that outlet over to both of the views in the storyboard.

## Viewcontroller.swift

* And now, loop through `interactiveSubviews` in its didSet observer.

```swift
  let laughPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(fileName: "hehehe")

  @IBOutlet var interactiveSubviews: [UIImageView]! {
    didSet {
      for subview in interactiveSubviews {
      
      }
    }
  }

  @IBAction func handlePan(recognizer:UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
```

* Create a UITapGestureRecognizer for each view, specifying `handleTap` as the method to use.

```swift
      for subview in interactiveSubviews {
        let tapRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(
          target: self, action: #selector(handleTap)
        )
      }
```

* Set the delegate of the recognizer, 

```swift
          target: self, action: #selector(handleTap)
        )
        tapRecognizer.delegate = self
      }
```

* and add the recognizer to the subview.

```swift
        tapRecognizer.delegate = self
        subview.addGestureRecognizer(tapRecognizer)
      }
```

* That‚Äôs it! Build and run.

> You may be asked for mic access. Okay.

> Tap both views; they should each chomp.

# Interlude

**Jessy üò∫**

It works pretty well, except there‚Äôs one minor annoyance. If you drag one of the views a very slight amount, you can pan it, and the sound effect will still play. Which isn't what you want.

To solve this, you could modify your `handleTap` method to behave differently which it coincides with other gestures, but there's a simpler solution: setting gesture recognizer dependencies.

You can require one recognizer to fail before another can succeed.

# Demo

## ViewController.swift

The pan gestures are the ones that we'll want to require to fail. 

* To access them, you can start with all of the gesture recognizers attached to an interactive subview, using UIView's `gestureRecognizers` property. Let's do that in `viewDidLoad`.

```swift
  let laughPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(fileName: "hehehe")

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    interactiveSubviews.map {
      $0.gestureRecognizers!
    }
  }

  @IBOutlet var interactiveSubviews: [UIImageView]! {
```

* Then, get the first (and only) one that is a `UIPanGestureRecognizer`.

```swift
$0.gestureRecognizers!.first { $0 is UIPanGestureRecognizer }!
```

* For each one of those, you'll need the tap recognizer attached to its view, which you can grab similarly:

> HI EDITOR! Messed this next block up

```swift
    interactiveSubviews.map {
      $0.gestureRecognizers!.first { $0 is UIPanGestureRecognizer }!
    }
    .forEach { panRecognizer in
      panRecognizer.view!.gestureRecognizers!
      .first { $0 is UITapGestureRecognizer }!
    }
```

* Now, require the pan recognizer to fail, for the tap recognizer to succeed.

```swift
      .first { $0 is UITapGestureRecognizer }!
      .require(toFail: panRecognizer)
    }
```

Now the tap gesture recognizer will only get called if no pan is detected.
