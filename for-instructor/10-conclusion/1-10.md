# Conclusion

👯JESSY😺 Congratulations! You’re now mastered the fundamentals of gesture recognizers, both built-in and custom!  
👯CATIE🐸 Let's review what you've learned, and go over what you might want to investigate next.

**Jessy 😺**

**[Slide 01]** You've become familiar with four built-in UIGestureRecognizer subclasses: UITap–, –Pinch–, –Rotation–, and –PanGestureRecognizer.

You know how to add them to views in Interface Builder and in Swift.

**[Slide 02]** Apple currently provides three more; you'll definitely find them all to be useful: They're for Swipes, Screen Edge Panning, and Long Pressing.

The ways you initiate the gestures are all different, of course, but as you've seen, connecting them to views and code will be easy for you, because that's a similar process for all gesture recognizers.

**[Slide 3]** For custom gesture recognizers, the sky's the limit. No matter how simple or complex it might need to be, though, the consistency and simplicity of the UIGestureRecognizer API will support you.

If you'd like to try out something more advanced, we've got a tutorial on raywenderlich.com on Creating Custom Recognizers which should satisfy your appetite. The gesture you'll be trying to recognize is a circle: it doesn't *sound* that complicated, but getting it to feel right and behave as expected is trickier than you'd expect. And it uses a lot more math than you did in this course.

👯JESSY😺 We'd like to thank you for joining us for Gesture Recognizers in iOS.  
👯CATIE🐸 Hopefully, you're starting to imagine the ways you can use gestures for great user experiences in your apps.  
👯JESSY😺 Or, if you want to go crazy-creative with touch input, iPad Pros support 17 touches at once! It might be a good place to experiment!  
👯CATIE🐸 Have fun!
