# Video Metadata

List out each part of the course and each video within that part. For each video, provide a description that is **between 100 and 160 characters long**. Some examples are below.

If a video uses a different language, platform, or editor than is used in the rest of the course, specify in brackets at the end of the description.

The first video in each course is automatically free to non-subscribers. Choose one other video that you think might entice people to subscribe and watch the entire course, and mark it with [FREE] at the end of the description.


1. *Introduction*: Learn a bit of the history of gesture recognizers in iOS, and what we will be covering in this course.

2. *UIPanGestureRecognizer*: Attach a UIPanGestureRecognizer to a view in Interface Builder, and write some Swift to have your pan gestures interact with that view.

3. *Deceleration*: Leverage UIKit's animation API, combined with information from your pan gesture recognizer, to decelerate a view you toss around the screen.

4. *Pinch & Rotation*: Manipulate the CGAffineTransform associated with a view based on pinch and rotation gestures. Also, learn to use multiple gesture recognizers at once!

5. *Challenge: Multiple Views*: Practice working with the types of gesture recognizers you've already learned about, resulting in simultaneous control of multiple views with multiple gestures.

6. *Programmatic UIGestureRecognizers*: Extend your knowledge of creating gesture recognizers, from Interface Builder, to Swift, and get introduced to UIGestureRecognizerDelegate.

7. *Custom UIGestureRecognizers*: Now that you're familiar with how to use existing gesture recognizers, you'll dive into their inner workings, creating one of your own.

8. *Introduction to simd*: Even though the app you've made in this course is small, you've written quite a bit of math-heavy code. simd can make that easier on you in the future!

9. *Challenge: simd*: With a primer to simd under your belt, see if you can finish tidying up the vector math that your gesture recognizers rely on.

10. *Conclusion*: Review all the types of UIGestureRecognizers you've learned about, and get a recommendation on where to learn more.
